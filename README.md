# Hello, I'm Thiago Tolotti ðŸ‘‹
  
<br/>

Iâ€™m a Brazilian and Italian developer with a background in design and a strong interest in frontend and fullstack engineering.

Iâ€™ve been working with web technologies since 2020 and currently lead the frontend development of two core products at Riole â€” a videoconferencing web app and a legislative process management platform.

Iâ€™m currently studying Agile Software Development at the postgraduate level and expanding my backend skills with Node.js and Go.
