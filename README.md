# Hello, I'm Thiago Tolotti 👋
  
<br/>

I’m a frontend developer with a background in design, working in web development since late 2020. 

Over the last two years I’ve developed several applications, mainly a videoconferencing platform and a legislative process management system.

I’m currently in a postgraduate program in Agile Software Development and building a personal delivery project to improve my technical and product-building skills. 

I also have a Brazilian-Italian dual citizenship.
